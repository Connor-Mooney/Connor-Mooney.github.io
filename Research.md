## Overview

I am broadly interested in the intersection of condensed matter physics, quantum information science, and condensed matter physics. A few more specific areas:
* Results understanding the effects of locality constraints on 
dynamics, eigenstate structure, and the performance of quantum algorithms, such as extended Lieb-Robinson bounds and state-transfer protocols
* Rigorous results in quantum dynamics, such as extensions of the adiabatic theorem
* Results using tools from functional analysis and operator algebrae to analyze many-body quantum systems
