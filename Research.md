## Overview

I am broadly interested in the intersection of condensed matter physics, quantum information science, and condensed matter physics. A few more specific areas:
* Results understanding the effects of locality constraints on 
dynamics, eigenstate structure, and the performance of quantum algorithms, such as extended Lieb-Robinson bounds and state-transfer protocols
* Rigorous results in quantum dynamics, such as extensions of the adiabatic theorem
* Results using tools from functional analysis and operator algebrae to analyze many-body quantum systems

At slow-enough timescales, quantum dynamics starting in the ground state are rigorously governed by the adiabatic theorem, which guarantees approximate spectral transport, with error (heuristically) scaling like $$\sim(\Gamma^2 T)^{-1}$$ where $$\Gamma$$ is the spectral gap of the Hamiltonian. These guarantees have been harnessed, for instance, to give an alternative method of quantum computing equivalent in computational power to the standard one; to perform a computation, one need only evolve a given input state by a family of Hamiltonians whose initial ground state is the input state and whose final ground state is the output.
