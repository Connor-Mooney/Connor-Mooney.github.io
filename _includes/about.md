Hi! My name is Connor, and this is my personal website. I'm a physics PhD candidate at the University of Maryland, College Park. I work with [Alexey Gorshkov][gorshkov] and [Andrew Childs][achilds]. My research interests lie at the intersection of mathematical physics, condensed matter theory, and quantum information science. [Here][CV] is my CV.

[Here][Research] is a more detailed summary of my research. <!--I also am planning to have written up a number of posts about various things that interest me, be they fiction I've recently read, historical topics, or just mathematical and/or physical points I think don't get emphasized enough.--> Please feel free to look around, and contact me via the envelope icon on the bottom of the site if you have any thoughts, questions or comments!
